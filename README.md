# PyPoll Challenge

In this challenge we were asked to help a small town organize its out dated vote-counting process, in which they had a single man tallying them up. We were given a csv file containing the Voter ID, County and Candidate data and asked to help organize anlyze the votes and calculate the following using Python script: 

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

#I analyzed the data with various Python methods that were commentated and dsiplayed in the attached main.py file. 

# The results were displayed as follows after we developed our script
