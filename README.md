# PyPoll Challenge

In this challenge we were asked to help a small town organize its out dated vote-counting process, in which they had a single man tallying them up. We were given a csv file containing the Voter ID, County and Candidate data and asked to help organize and analyze the votes along with calculating the following using Python script: 

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

I analyzed the data with various Python methods that were commentated and displayed in the attached main.py file. to illustrate all the necessary values we needed to calculate.


#Conclusion

Our results effectively oragnized the small town's votes into an easy to read txt file that summarized the total votes, total amount of votes per candidate along with their percentage of the total vote, and the ultimate winner of the small town's election. Fortunately the town's out dated polling process required just a quick fix and unveiled how easy it is to gather data calculations and values from a large data set using Python. The key takeaway were that are simple ways once you have the data stored in a readable txt file such a csv it easy to use Python methods to read through and gather values from it in order to display results such as number and percentage of votes.
